Get off your ass
One who does not work shall not eat
you can get more things done faster when you're on cocaine!
reality is for people who cant face drugs
Never trust a person who isn't having at least one crisis
"obstacles do not exist to be surrendered to, but only to be broken"
"Do not compare yourself to others. If you do so, you are insulting yourself."
Anyone can deal with victory. Only the mighty can bear defeat. 
Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.
